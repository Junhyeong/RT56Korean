 SCA_iceland.1.t:0 "Consider a Invasion of Iceland"
 SCA_iceland.1.desc:0 "Denmark has fallen, but their subject, Iceland remains free from German interference. However we have reliable reports that suggest that Germany may be interested in Iceland as a staging ground for an invasion of Scotland. Despite our diplomats best efforts, Iceland remain staunchly neutral in this conflict. This has lead to calls for an invasion of Iceland to force their compliance."

 SCA_iceland.4:0 "Iceland Requests Volunteers"
 SCA_iceland.4.t:0 "Iceland Requests Volunteers"
 SCA_iceland.4.desc:0 "One of our small partners, Iceland, has requested volunteers in order to help them drive the revolution forward. Although not powerful, Iceland is in an extremely strategic location near the British Isles, and providing them with men may be an excellent way to prepare ourselves for a possible confrontation with the imperialists."
 SCA_iceland.4.a:0 "We shall give them as many men as we can!"
 SCA_iceland.4.b:0 "We can help our small friend."
 SCA_iceland.4.c:0 "We can only provide transportation for those who wish to go."
    SCA_iceland.5:0 "[SOV.GetName] Sends Many Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.5.t:0 "[SOV.GetName] Sends Many Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.5.desc:0 "The [SOV.GetName] has responded very positively to our request for volunteers. They have sent over 300,000 men and enough supplies to feed them for a few years.

    SCA_iceland.7.t:0 "[SOV.GetName] Sends Few Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.7.desc:0 "The [SOV.GetName] has responded to our request for volunteers. [SOV.GetLeader] has sent a letter apologizing for not being to officially send us any men.

 SCA_iceland.8.t:0 "Flokkur Þjóðernissinna Coup"
 SCA_iceland.8.desc:0 "In a stunning move today, members of the Flokkur Þjóðernissinna staged a sudden coup against the government. Claiming to be representing the "will of the people", [ICE.Fascism.GetLeader] has proclaimed himself to be the new head of government which is to be restructored away from the parliamentary model, and towards a corporatist model with [ICE.Fascism.GetLeader] at its head. Although there are rumours of discontent within the party, their supremacy is definitely unquestioned, at least for now."
 SCA_iceland.8.a:0 "Iceland shall be led to a new era of greatness."
 
 SCA_iceland.9:0 "Coastguard Focus Debate"
 SCA_iceland.9.t:0 "Coastguard Focus Debate"
 SCA_iceland.9.desc:0 "Iceland's coast guard is not a navy in the full sense of the word. They protect our shores and our skies, but their job has remained that of a protective, guard force. It is time that we decide once and for all if they are truly a guard force, or indeed the navy and air force of Iceland."
 SCA_iceland.9.a:0 "They are both."
 SCA_iceland.9.b:0 "They are our navy, first and foremost."

 SCA_iceland.100.desc:0 "Denmark, our partner in the Union of Denmark and Iceland, has fallen to the German invaders. Although the government remains the same, we cannot heed anything they say, for it will be from the mouth of the Reich.
